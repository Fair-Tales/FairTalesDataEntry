Analyse this photo of a children's picture book page.

Instructions:
1. Correct for any rotation or tilt in the image. Focus on the book page itself \
and ignore any background (table, hands, etc.).
2. Transcribe ALL text visible on the page exactly as written. Include speech \
bubbles and captions. Do not include page numbers.
   - If a word or passage is difficult to read (blurred, partially obscured, \
unusual lettering), enclose it in square brackets with a question mark: [like this?]
   - If you cannot make out any part of a word at all, write [?] in its place.
3. Classify whether this is a STORY page — meaning it contains narrative text \
that is part of the story itself. The following page types are NOT story pages: \
title page, half-title, copyright, dedication, contents, about the author, \
publisher information, back-cover synopsis, end matter, blank pages.

Respond with valid JSON only — no other text before or after. Example of the \
expected format:
{
  "text": "Once upon a time, a [small?] rabbit lived in the forest.",
  "is_story_page": true,
  "page_type": "story"
}

Now analyse the image and return JSON:"""
